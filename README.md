Getting started
----------------------------------

#### Installing Ionic

If you have not already installed Ionic into your local environment, please install it through typing the following command into your bash:

```bash
npm install -g ionic
```

#### Starting Your Project
After installing Ionic to your local environment, you will have a number of different ways to create your starting project through Ionic's cli.

```bash
ionic start <yourApp> blank

ionic start <yourApp> tabs

ionic start <yourApp> sidemenu
```

The first command creates a blank Ionic project for you to work with, while the last two creates an Ionic project with pre-built features, tabs and sidemenu respectively.

#### Serving Your App

To run your app, cd into your project's directory and serve it through typing in the following command into your bash.

```bash
cd <yourApp>
ionic serve
```
